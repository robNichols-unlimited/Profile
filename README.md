# Profile

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.1.
The purpose of this project is to be a splash page portfolio, sharing some of the projects that I have worked on professionally and personally. 
Those personal projects that are currently hosted will have a link to them in the project listing.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4300/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Or run `ng serve -o` to have a browser window auto-magically open for you and watch/reload and changes to the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Currently e2e tests have not been created
